gmail.vim
=========

Description
-----------
The vim script for viewing gmail on vim.
You need to enable imap settings gmail, because this plugin use imap.


Requirements
------------

* vimproc
Interactive command execution in Vim.

    https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc

* openssl
A toolkit implementing SSL v2/v3 and TLS protocols with full-strength cryptography world-wide.
I have been tested to work with openssl included in msysgit for Windows.

    http://www.openssl.org/
    http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/


Setting
-------

* Enable imap
    Please enable imap settings gmail.
    (Please search on yourself)

* Install vimproc
    If you have installed Vundle, please set as follows in your .vimrc.

        Bundle git://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.git

* Through the path to openssl

    let &path = $path . 'c:\Program files\git\bin'

* vimrc settings such as described in the following. (Not required)

  - Server settings

        let g:gmail_imap = 'imap.gmail.com:993'

        let g:gmail_smtp = 'smtp.gmail.com:465'

  - User name settings

        let g:gmail_user_name = 'xxx@gmail.com'

  - Signature when sending mail

        let g:gmail_signature = '# ' . g:gmail_user_name . '(by gmail.vim)'


Usage
-----

* Start

Use the following commands in Command mode to start Gmail.

    :Gmail

* Operations

The first line of each screen is the menu.
Please move cursor on the menu you want to perform, and press the Enter key.

Two Factor Authentication
-------------------------

* Setup an application specific password for gmail.vim under your google security settings.
* Create the following ~/.anyname
* Please set the file name that can not be analogized to .anyname.

```vim
let g:gmail_user_name = 'xxx@gmail.com'
call gmail#imap#set_password('application_specific_password')
```

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.anyname
# NOTE THE DOUBLE ARROW - SINGLE WILL OVERWRITE YOUR VIMRC
echo 'source ~/.anyname' >> ~/.vimrc
```

This will allow you to keep your application specific password private, even if you share your vimrc publically via github or elsewhere.
